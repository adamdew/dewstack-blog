Hello out there. Happy labor day if you've been laboring lately. I decided to spin up this blog because I wanted to try hosting a website at home off my crappy rig.

Right now I'm running this site on a 2015 Dell Laptop I used in college. It also hosts my media server. I want to see exactly how far I can push this machine and pack it full of little docker containers of my projects. I've got Ubuntu server running on it with some containerized services.

This blog will be all about the services and projects i run out of my Homelab. Just last night I got this domain (dewstack.dev) and I plan to run some services with it including:

- Home media server (working more or less with a Tailscale network of my family)
- Family social media network (Mastadon self hosted)
- This blog

Also in this blog I'll be talking about:

- Work work
- PHP/JS dev
- Frontend/backend
- Hardware
- Computer Networking
- Office life
- E-Commerce
- BBQ
