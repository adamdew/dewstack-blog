Hey there, yesterday I made some pretty good ribs. This was my 3rd or 4th time doing St. Louis ribs on the Weber kettle grill. Here was my method:

- set up a 2 layered charcoal snake
- 3 hours on the smoker at 250F no foil
- 2 hours foil on (when i was happy with the color)
- 1 hour no foil and brushed with BBQ sauce

This time my wife wanted to try out a new BBQ sauce, Sweet Baby Rays Hawaiian. We liked it. I thought it added a sweet undertone.
